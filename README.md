# Application-of-Data-Mining-Techniques

This project was made for the University class "Data Mining Techniques".
The task was to create a Wordcloud for the five categories of articles, apply clustering in the various text files, 
and use the KMeans clustering algorithm to test 4 classification methods.

# What I Learned

* Clustering implementation
* Evaluating data mining techniques 
* Training algorithms
